# Customer Persona

## Primary User: The Competitive VC Scout

**Role**: Associate / Principal / Junior Partner at a Series A/B venture capital fund
**Age Range**: 26-38
**Location**: Major VC hubs (NYC, SF, London, Berlin)
**Fund Profile**: Mid-tier or emerging fund ($100M-$500M AUM), trying to break into the top tier

---

## Demographics

- 5-10 years in venture capital or adjacent fields (investment banking, consulting, growth equity)
- Digitally native — grew up with swipe-based apps, gamified interfaces, and real-time data
- High screen time (6+ hours/day), phone is primary information source
- Active on Twitter/X, LinkedIn, and VC-specific newsletters

---

## Core Anxieties

- **Fear of missing deals**: Constant worry that better-connected VCs are seeing opportunities first
- **Opaque market**: No real-time visibility into what other firms are looking at or where sectors are heating up
- **Unproven track record**: No objective, public measure of prediction accuracy — promotions depend on politics, not performance
- **Information overload**: Drowning in newsletters, pitch decks, and databases that feel stale and slow

---

## Behavioral Traits

- **Competitive by nature**: Tracks personal performance in all areas of life (fitness, investing, career milestones)
- **Gut-driven but data-validated**: Trusts pattern recognition, then looks for numbers to confirm instincts
- **Status-conscious**: Aware of industry rankings, conference speakers, media mentions — wants to climb
- **Impatient with friction**: Will abandon any tool that requires more than 30 seconds before delivering value
- **FOMO-susceptible**: Reacts strongly to signals that peers are moving on something

---

## What They Need

- Fast, low-effort market scanning that fits into 5-minute gaps between meetings
- Real-time collective intelligence on startup sentiment and sector momentum
- A visible, verifiable track record that proves their ability to spot winners
- Competitive context — where they stand relative to other VCs in their niche

---

## What Motivates Them to Engage

- **Recognition**: Feeling understood — "this product gets what my job actually feels like"
- **Competition**: Leaderboards, rival tracking, niche dominance rankings
- **Relief**: Reducing the anxiety of not knowing what the market is doing
- **Status**: Building a public performance score that carries weight

---

## What Converts Them

- Instant value with zero signup friction (anonymous swipe loop)
- Social proof that other VCs are already on the platform
- A moment of genuine insight they couldn't get elsewhere ("I didn't know 12 VCs were watching this startup")
- The feeling of being early to something — the same instinct that drives their job

---

## Secondary Persona: The Senior Partner

- **Role**: Managing Partner / GP at established fund
- **Engagement pattern**: Less frequent, but pulled in by rivalry pings and niche dominance alerts
- **Core driver**: Territorial — can't resist checking if someone is encroaching on their sector
- **Value**: Validates the platform's credibility and attracts the primary persona through top-down adoption
