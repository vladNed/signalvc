User Persona
Main User Persona: Venture Capitalists - Ideal user for our app is a VC with a high degree of interest in fast moving markets like tech, healthcare, fintech.

They Are Forced To Move Fast - Due to market conditions they are forced to move fast and take over entire niches of markets to capitalize on their investments.

Trend Driven - VCs are simple people, they are driven by (mostly) trends and numbers. Whatever is the shiny new market/startup/stock/etc. Will attract VC interest.

Trends Are People Driven - The entire stock market is driven by trust, not by actual measurable outputs (revenue, profits, costs, assets). Trust is built between a VC and their investments and between VCs with similar portfolios.
Product Description

This project's main core idea is that the venture capital landscape is driven by hype. The hype machine that drives investment decisions is fueled mainly by these:
The fear of missing out on a possible great investment (FOMO)
The fact that other peer investors have already taken the leap (peer pressure/competition)

Portfolio Creation

The project aims to have VC’s that use the app to build a portfolio of startups and companies in which they are interested and can later invest, contact, or follow their activity with the latest data.

With the mechanism of swiping taken from Tinder like apps, we define the swipe left/right actions.
Swipe left - Not interested in the startup
Swipe right - Interested in the startup and the company is added to the portfolio of startups

> Note: Because we have a lot of data, we can import some of the VC’s portfolio upon account creation

Two other main actions will contribute to how a VC interacts with a startup if they are not interested but they still want to follow the journey:
Swipe up - If the VC thinks the startup will have a good performance in the future
Swipe down - If the VC thinks the startup will have a bad performance in the future

Hype Index

The project aims to have 3 core hype metrics:

1. Personal Performance Score

This key metric reflects the ability to accurately predict success of startups. It’s calculated based on two main factors:
Portfolio Contributions: We evaluate the performance of the startups you’ve added over time
Prediction Accuracy: We assess how well you’ve predicted when swiping up or down on startups
Ratio between accurate preds / total preds
Accurate preds: correctly predicts

The goal of this metric is to have a transparent evaluation of your decision-making abilities. 2. Peers Score

This key metric reflects the level of interest and attention from other VC’s in a particular startup sector. This score is generated based on:
Sector Hype: The number of VC firms interested in investing in the same sector as the startup.
Peer Validation: The collective interest of other VC’s towards any startup.

The goal of this metric is to show:
How many VC firms are actively promoting the sector of the startup
The level of enthusiasm
The relative scarcity of investment opportunities within the sector

A high peer score indicates that a startup is in high demand and multiple VC’s are interested and a low peer score suggests that interest may be down or unevenly distributed. This score shows the market sentiment and trends. 3. Bull/Bear Score

This key metric reflects the collective sentiment of other investors towards a particular startup but they didn’t yet get actively interested.

This score is generated by:
Up/Down Swipes: The number of times a VC has swiped up or down on a startup

The goal of this metric is to show a metric similar to the fear/greed index for cryptocurrencies. Based on this score usually we aim to have VC’s be more interested or not on a startup because of the market sentiment

4. Thirst Score

Come up with a better name.

A score that is presents the amount of activity a VC has in the app (the amount if UPs and DOWNs per hour)
Helps us identify most of the dedicated users
Used for displaying a Grade of dedication for a VC (i.e. trend setter - for VC that up/down on a low activity startup and the activity spikes right after OR like minded - follows the general sentiment when swiping up/down)
Display of Hype Index

For the main flow where the user will swipe on different startups, beside the core data about the startup, the peers score and bull/bear score will be shown on each startup. The startup cards can have these scores displayed:
On Top: Making this the first item you see and the most important
As bubbles: Bubbles that float on the right or left
Relationship Defined Market Intelligence

Relationships between individuals and mainly between competitors VC’s can drive collaboration or competition.

If these relationships are stored in these metrics, we can show a transparent snapshot of what they are and mostly intensify the feeling of competition between the VC’s.

The app is targeting VC’s to compete first between themselves and predict & invest in the most hyped companies but also compete with themselves and get a much better performance score than other peers in the market.

Funnelling
Stage 1: Relevance
Prove relevance instantly - by showing niche + network-specific hype before asking for effort. This enables the VCs to understand their place within the app and the founder’s ecosystem.

Convincing Attractions - Having the VCs’ portfolios already loaded, we have their brief attention when that portfolio is presented in the context of the broad market (NYSE style) and their niches (other VCs portfolios) generating. This clash of (my investments vs theirs) could make the VC interested enough to start researching the competition (other VCs and their startups)

Brief Attention For Simple Data - Since the VC is not familiarized with the app, ecosystem nor investments the data we should show should be simple, easy to understand at a glance.

Show A Clear Competition - Make it very obvious that my investments in a specific niche are fighting for a market that is already populated with another VC’s investments.
Stage 2: Interactions
Me vs Them mentality is easy to grasp - Once the user understands that there are other VCs investing in the competition within the niche that user will begin investigating said competition.

Deeper Understanding - We are at the point where the user already understands that their way to investigate competing startups and competing market sentiment regarding their niche, investments and startups.

Market Predictions Creates Influence - We now start showing the user the main way to create adversity within the app. The swipes:
Up -> this startup has potential to grow
Down -> this startup does not have the potential to grow

Swipes Are Public - Swipe UPs will register the VC to “follow” that startup notifying when they will grow.

Swipes Influence Your Personal Perf Score

Swipes Influence The Aggregated Personal Perf Score

Swipes Affect The Startups’ Bull/Bear Score

By the time the user gets here, he’s deeply knowledgeable about the app’s main actions.
Stage 3: Realtime Market Dynamics Generate Social Pressure
Market Updates Notify Users - There are 4 kinds of users that are notified when something happens in the market regarding a startup:
Investors -> they are notified that their investment is growing
Followers -> they successfully predicted that the startup will grow
Investors Within The Same Niche -> They need to be notified when the "competition" is growing
Haters (maybe a different name) -> VSc that predicted that the startup will not grow

Velocity Notifs - Show notifications that certain VCs or startups started to massively generate interest (swipes, investments, fast growth of the scores). These are not market events, they are in app only events, that are relevant to VCs invested in the startups, users with swipes UP/Down and VCs with investments in that niche.

Notifications Draw Attention - This intrinsically generates hype.

Show The 3 Scores - Once a user enters the app from a notif. Make the scores very obvious. Show how his scores and the other’s score are impacted by this market event.

High Degree Of Conversion - These notifs will generate interest + the displayed scores that generate hype and adversity convert the user into a long term one.

Engagement Hooks
Racing Like Notifications - Where certain VCs from a single niche market get to see each other's progress within the app and market. // Develop

Core Concept: The app gamifies FOMO by w Notifications are not passive updates; they are alerts that the user is falling behind or losing position in real-time.

The “Slipstream” alert
Utilizing the "VCs Fuel VCs" dynamic to create drafting behavior.

Mechanism: When a "Market Leader" (a VC with a high Trust Score) enters a new niche or engages heavily with a specific trend, users in the same sector receive a "Slipstream Alert."

Psychological Hook: "Competitor X is moving on MedTech. Are they seeing something you aren't?" This triggers immediate app entry to verify the intelligence.

Niche Dominance Leaderboards
Moving away from global rankings to focus on specific "Micro-Races."

Mechanism: Live, fluctuating leaderboards for specific niches (e.g., Generative AI, Sustainable Energy). Rankings are determined by the user's "3 (+1) Scores."

Psychological Hook: Status seeking. A VC may not care about their global rank, but they will fight to remain the #1 Influencer in Fintech. Seeing their rank drop from #1 to #2 drives engagement to regain the top spot.

"Velocity" Warnings (Heat Checks)
Visualizing the intensity of the competition in real-time.

Mechanism: Notifications trigger based on the speed of activity, not just the content.
Example: "High Velocity Warning: 15 VCs in your network are viewing 'Bio-Data' assets right now."

Psychological Hook: Urgency. It validates that a trend is happening now, forcing the user to participate in the "race" before the opportunity window closes.

Rivalry Pings (1v1 Competition)
Personalizing the "Relationships Defined" market intelligence.

Mechanism: Users can tag specific other VCs as direct "Rivals." The app provides hyper-specific updates on these rivals.
Example: "Your Rival, [Name], just increased their Trust Score in [Niche] by 10 points."
Psychological Hook: Direct competition. This makes market intelligence feel personal and adversarial, increasing the emotional investment in the app's data.

Long Term Considerations
Monetization

1. Tiered Intelligence Subscriptions
   A monthly high-ticket recurring revenue model based on access to data depth.
   Analyst Tier: Includes basic trust scores, standard racing notifications, and tracking for up to 3 niche markets.
   Partner Tier: Unlocks "Whale Watching" capabilities, visibility into high-level market movements before they trend. Includes predictive analytics based on aggregate user behavior and unlimited competitor portfolio lookups.

2. Deal Flow Origination Fees
   Leveraging the "Relationships Defined Market Intelligence" value proposition to monetize the connection.

If the app identifies a high-compatibility match between two entities (VC to VC for syndication, or VC to Founder) based on trust scores and niche alignment, a "Gatekeeper Fee" is applied to unlock the direct introduction.
