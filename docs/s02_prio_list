S02 - Initial Product Feature Development Plan
Jan ‘26 - Christian, Vlad, Cosmin

Anonymous swipe loop (instant relevance, zero friction) - Ship a no-account-first (anon) experience that proves instant value by letting VCs act on trends immediately (Stage 1: Relevance). The goal is to trigger FOMO + peer pressure before asking for effort, while still preserving actions if they convert in-session.
Anonymous user actions:
Swipe Up: User Believes Startup Increases In Valuation
Swipe Down: User Believes Startup Decreases In Valuation
Swipe Left: Ignore
Swipe Right: Invest
Unlimited Up/Downs And Limited Left/Right
 
Store Session And Move To Account If The User Signs Up: Any actions taken will be saved if the user creates an account during the same session.
Product features needed: gesture handling + action throttling (limited Left/Right), session storage (anon state), and signup “migration” that replays saved actions into the new account.

Behavior rationale: Up/Down is the high-frequency “sentiment engine” (Bull/Bear + later PPS prediction accuracy), while Left/Right is high-signal portfolio intent and must feel scarcer. It is much easier to hook a user based on their own “quick” thinking actions (up/down) that have no real impact to their potential future portfolio.

Data
Reel Info Card (anon) = hype-first snapshot - The reel must show niche + network-specific hype immediately so the user understands “what’s hot” and “who else cares” at a glance. This is the primary surface that converts scrolling into swiping.
Reel Info Card with anon, data required:
 Bull/Bear score
 Peer Score
 MRR
 Industry (+ Niche?)
 Ticket size (Valuation)
 HQ Position (geography)
 Leaderboard Preview
 Founders ??
Product features needed: a compact card layout optimized for 1–2 second reads, plus a clear hierarchy where Peer Score and Bull/Bear score visually dominate (trend-driven persona).


Why this works: VCs are forced to move fast; showing social proof (scores + leaderboard preview) creates “me vs them” curiosity without requiring deep research.



Reel Info Card (account) = same surface, stronger meaning - Keep the reel lightweight, but once logged in, every score should feel like it impacts status and competition (Stage 2: Interactions). The same data becomes “personal” because it ties into the user’s portfolio, reputation, and future leaderboard rank.
Reel Info Card with account, data required:
 Bull/Bear Score
 Peer Score
 Industry (+ Niche?)
 Ticket size (Valuation)
 HQ Position (geography)
 Leaderboard Preview
 Founders ??
Product features needed: account-aware personalization logic behind the scenes (without changing the fields) so the reel ordering + leaderboard preview reflect “my niche vs theirs.” -> Essentially, a recommendation engine.


Key principle: keep the UX simple, but make the implications competitive.

Portfolio Menu Info Card (deeper context + competitive intel) - Once the VC has a portfolio, the app must shift from “swipe” to “investigate.” This card is where we provide deeper understanding while still keeping it skimmable and rivalry-driven.
Portfolio Menu Info Card, data required:
 Peer Score
 Industry (+ Niche?)
 Ticket Size
 Founders
 Total Revenue
 Investors
 Team Size
 HQ Position (geography)
 Sentiment over time for startup
 Leaderboard
Product features needed: portfolio screen navigation, startup detail drilldown, and a simple sentiment-over-time visualization that makes momentum obvious. -> For the long term think of the sentiment timeline


Why this matters: “relationships defined market intelligence” only works if the user can quickly see competition (Investors + Leaderboard) and trend direction (Sentiment over time).

Startup Card (swipe-first presentation) - Define the minimal startup “unit” that powers the reel: fast, number-led, trend-aware, and consistent with the hype metrics.
Startup Card:
 Leaderboard Card
Product features needed: card component system that contains score badges, and a clear path into the info card/portfolio card. -> optimized for quick understanding (all the context required to make quick decisions <<up/down>>)



Sentiment over time (foundation for velocity + notifications later) - Store and display time-based activity so the product can evolve into “velocity warnings” and market-dynamics notifications (Stage 3), even if notifications are not shipped yet.

Recommendation Engine
Relevant Startup Recommandations Keeps The User Engaged - Each startup will be indexed based on a set of data points (outlined below) relative to the interest of each individual VC. Based on the relevance score, they will be served in the feeds of these VCs.

Relevance Score = w1 * IndustryMatch
                + w2 * TicketSizeMatch
                + w3 * GeographyMatch
                + w4 * PeerScore
                + w5 * BullBearScore
                + w7 * MRRGrowth


Exp: grography_score = w - (distance_km / max_distance_threshold)
I.e. max_distance_threshold = 4000km

A max distance threshold is required as the closer in proximity a startup’s HQ is to a VC it assumes a higher degree of trust. (i.e. a VC from Germany will have little to no interest in the India’s startup ecosystem)

Product features needed: scoring service + weights config, distance calculation (HQ Position), and feed generation that blends “personal fit” with “market heat.” -> i.e. relevance score with bull/bear scores.


Outcome goal: the user should feel both “this matches me” and “others are moving on this,” which is the exact hype loop the product is built on.

Needed Data

Startup Table:
Name
Team Size
Description
Industry
Valuation
HQ Position
Founders (just names)
Investors (FK)

Investors Table:
Name
Web domain name
HQ Location

Investors Portfolio Table:
Investor ID
Startup ID
Initial startup valuation (entry)
Current startup valuation (actual)
Entry Ticket size
Current ticket size

Deductible data by us, from the data above:

Personal Performance Score: Derived from the VC’s actual portfolio 
PPS = ((Vt2 - Vt1) / Vt1) * w1 + ((Tt2 - Tt1) / Tt1) * w2
Peer Score
PS = (no_startup_investors / total_industry_investors)
Note: we can add weights to investors that this industry is their main industry and will affect the total_industry_investors
Leaderboard:
Made based on personal performance score
